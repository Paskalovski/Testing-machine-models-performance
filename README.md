### Testing Algorithms performance 

#### The idea is to test 3 types of machine algorithms for variable performance aspects and chose the best one
#### Prediction Task: 
- Predicting whether an individual makes more than $50,000, using the U.S. Census dataset

#### Algorithms chosen for the task:
- Decision Tree Classifier 
- SVC 
- Ada Boost Classifier

#### Application Content:
- Data Visualization 
- Data Preprocessing
- Defining the models 
  - Defining a Training and Predicting Pipeline
  - Defining the training models  
  - Initializing the models 
- Models Performance Visualization
  - Speed Performance
  - Accuracy Results
  - F-score
  - Confusion Matrices 
- Conclusion
